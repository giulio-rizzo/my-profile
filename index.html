				<h2> Music 🎸 🎧 🔊 </h2>
				<p>I'm also passionate about music: I play guitar and I love rock music. My favourite band is Red Hot Chili Peppers, a Californian 🏄 🌊 90's rock band. I am inspired by its iconic guitarist, John Frusciante, who compesed one of the most significant guitar riffs in the history of Rock Music. I mean Under the Bridge riff. 
				Below, you can understand that. </p>
